# sonos_receiver
A little project to switch inputs on a receiver to the sonos when it starts playing music and back again when the music has paused. Uses a raspberry pi with a little IR LED attached to it points at the receiver. 

Leverages https://github.com/jishi/node-sonos-http-api to get easy access to the currently playing song.
